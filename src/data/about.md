# Intro

I am a regular guy - married with two grown-up children with a mortgage and bills to pay.  

Outside of my regular day job, I established Qeetoto to support various entrepreneurial business initiatives I have had over the years; the two most successful of which have been Texas Hedge'Em - an online poker-based gambling game and ConsentWise.io - An Open Banking Testing and Consultancy Service. I am currently working on another Qeetoto project to create a community to support workers in the Gig Economy.  I shall post more about this later but if you are interested now, please message me.

On the Gig Economy ... I love speaking to anyone about anything in this space so, if you share this interest, or have a 'Passion Project' that you would like to collaborate on with me or my colleagues, please connect with me on LinkedIn and let's chat.

# Some history

- I will populate this if you ping me on LinkedIn

# I like

- Pobbing.  Pobbing is a word I coined for doing anything that makes you happy.  Fun fact: My daughter thought it was a real word until the age of 17. (Sorry Eleanor!)


# Travel / Geography

- In 1968, Born in Farnborogh, Hampshire, United Kingdom.
- In 1972, Moved to Basildon, Essex, UK. (All though I would not have known as I was only four.)

- 2023 is just around the corner - who knows what this will bring.  I would like to visit Machu Picchu

# Companies that I admire

- [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/about/world-economic-forum/) Absolutely every post is truly inspirational and boost my faith in humanity
- [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/) A fantasitc, well designed, and engineered sustainable product that does not compromise on functionality or quality
