# Intro

I am a regular guy - married with two grown-up children with a mortgage and bills to pay.  

Outside of my regular day job, I established Qeetoto to support various entrepreneurial business initiatives I have had over the years; the most successful of which has been Texas Hedge'Em - an online poker-based gambling game which you can read more about below. I am currently pivoting Qeetoto to support workers in the Gig economy, which I shall post more on later. 

On the Gig Economy ... I love speaking to anyone about anything in this space so, if you share this interest, or would like to work together on a project with me or my colleagues, please ping me on LinkedIn and let's chat.
